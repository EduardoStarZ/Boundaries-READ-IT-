Hi, EduardoStarZ here

Thanks for stoping by and reading this

I would like to highlight what you can 
and can't do with my codes/projects both in github and 
throughout the internet


Q-Can i repost any of your work?

A-No, under any circunstance

Q-Can i get fragments of your codes and put in mine projects?

A-As long as you credit me properly if your project is shared in
the internet, i even encouraje it, go on

Q-Can i put your datapacks in a packs list and share it?

A-As long as you credit me, yes

Q-I'm a fan of your work and want to support you, how can i do it?

A-You can help me by spreading my github page online into any place
you'd like

Q-Do your datapacks need some configuration setting before starting 
to work?

A-Some of them do, as they use the scoreboards system,
but you don't have to guess what do needs to be set, i'll flag
which datapacks needs a configuration set before working, what and how 
to set and suggestions, if there's something to be highlighted

Q-Do your datapacks are compatible with versions bellow of 1.19?

A-Usually, yes they are, although you should expect some of the functions
in them not to work

Q-So if i download a datapack and put it on a inferior version world/server
am i good to go?

A-Even if it works, minecraft will tag the datapack as "made for a newer version",
so i suggest you to open the pack.mcmeta file in the datapack folder and change the 
pack version to whichever version you are playing on (if you don't know how to see 
which number is suitable for your version in specific, check the official wiki)
